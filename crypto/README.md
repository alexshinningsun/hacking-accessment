# stream cipher

------

stream_cipher.py is used to generate the **key** file with the flag string defined in the first line.

However, the flag is covered, you do not know the value of the flag. Try to analyze the algorithm used in stream_cipher.py, and recover the flag.

(the flag looks like: flag{13579BDF01234567}, there is a 64-bit hex value inside brace)

(use python2 )
